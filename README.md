# YouTube Comment Spam Detection

A machine learning-based project for detecting spam comments on YouTube using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Classifies YouTube comments as **spam** or **not spam**
- Preprocessing using NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization
- Model training using popular ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a labeled collection of YouTube comments with spam/non-spam classifications. You can find it in the `data/` directory (if included), or download it from a publicly available dataset source like Kaggle.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rayhan-Dodi/youtube-comment-spam-detection.git
   cd youtube-comment-spam-detection
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📊 Results

Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix plots will be shown after running the model.

## ✅ To-Do

* [ ] Improve model accuracy
* [ ] Add GUI for real-time comment checking
* [ ] Integrate deep learning (LSTM/BERT)

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change or improve.
